## About

The `eyelinkparser` module provides a framework to parse EyeLink data files in `.asc` format, that is, the format that you get after converting an `.edf` file with `edf2asc`. This module is mostly for personal use, and is not very well documented.

This package also contains experimental parsers for other eye trackers, which work in the same way except that you import from a different top-level package: `gazepointparser`, `eyetribeparser`, and `smiparser`. These packages are largely untested and may be broken.


## Installation

```
pip install eyelinkparser 
```

## Expected format

The parser assumes monocular recording.


## Expected messages

By default, the parser assumes that particular messages are sent to the logfile. If you use different messages, you need to override functions in `_eyelinkparser.EyeLinkParser`. This is not explained here, but you can look in the source code to see how it works.

Trial start:

	start_trial [trialid]
	
Trial end:

	end_trial
	stop_trial
	
Variables:

	var [name] [value]
	
Start of a period of continuous data:
	
	start_phase [name]
	phase [name]
	
End of a period of continuous data:

	end_phase [name]
	stop_phase [name]
